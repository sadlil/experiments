# Contributing to Pixel

:tada: Hi! I'm really glad you're considering contributing to Pixel! :tada:

## Here are a few ways you can contribute

1. **Make a community example** and place it inside the [examples/community](examples/community) folder.
2. **Add tests**. There only few tests in Pixel at the moment. Take a look at them and make some similar.
3. **Add a small feature or an improvement**. Feel like some small feature is missing? Just make a PR. Be ready that I might reject it, though, if I don't find it particularly appealing.
4. **Join the big development** by joining the discussion at the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/pixellib/Lobby), where we can discuss bigger changes and implement them after that.

## How to make a pull request

Go gives you a nice surprise when attempting to make a PR on Github. The thing is, that when user _xyz_ forks Pixel on Github, it ends up in _github.com/xyz/pixel_, which fucks up your import paths. Here's how you deal with that: https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2jdcw1/how_do_you_deal_with_github_forking/.
